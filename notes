what command can be used to show the alog history for a file? I want to display the date of the commit, the hash, and the top line of the commit message

git log --follow --date=short --pretty=format:'%ad %h %s' -- src/gitdiff/gitdiff.py



The markers are defined in gitdiff.py at gitdiff.py:141-149. Meaning:

" " (space): tracked and clean (no special style).
"!": conflicted — styled magenta.
"A": staged (index changes) — styled cyan.
"D": deleted in working tree — styled red.
"I": ignored — styled dim italic.
"M": modified (worktree/index modified) — styled yellow.
"?": untracked / new in worktree — styled grey50.
